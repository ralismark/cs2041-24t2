Python Types
------------

What are types?

	Unlike shell (but like C), values have types which determine what you can do with them

How do you see the type of something?

	type(value)

How do you figure out what you can do with a type?

	help(type(value)) or simply help(value)

There's roughly 8 built-in types -- can you name + explain them?

	str int bool float
	list tuple dict set

	Bonus uncommon ones: NoneType object function

There's more in the standard library: collections.Counter, collections.defaultdict (and others)
