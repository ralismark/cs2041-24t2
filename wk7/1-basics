Python Basics (ans)
-------------------

- running python interactively
  -> python3
  (just python is often python2, which is incompatible)
- what python version?
  -> 3.11
- where to get documentation?
  -> run python3, then help(...) e.g. help(open)
  -> https://docs.python.org/3.11/, "Tutorial" and "Library reference"
- what to use instead of #!/usr/bin/env dash?
  -> #!/usr/bin/env python3
  (since we want to find python via $PATH)
