Consider passwd.txt

1. Display lines belonging to class accounts (assuming that class accounts have a username that starts with either "cs", "se", "bi" or "en", followed by four digit)

	grep -E '^(cs|se|bi|en)[0-9]{4}' passwd.txt --color=auto

2. Display the first three lines of the file

	head -n3 passwd.txt

3. Get only the username and password of each user

	cut -d: -f1-2 passwd.txt
