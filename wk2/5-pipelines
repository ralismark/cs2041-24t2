Pipelines (and shell)
---------------------

Combining filters into more complicated data processing.

e.g. $ cut -f2 data.tsv | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n 10

---

stdin / stdout / stderr

cut -f2 file.txt | wc  =  stdout of cut --> stdin of wc

uniq a.txt > out.txt   =  stdout of uniq --> file out.txt

sort < data.csv        =  file data.csv --> stdin of sort
