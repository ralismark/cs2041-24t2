Scoping
-------

A student wrote `start_lab04.sh`:

	#!/usr/bin/env dash
	
	cd ~/src/unsw/24t2/comp2041
	
	ex1=jpg2png
	ex2=email_image
	ex3=date_image
	ex4=tag_music

But running it doesn't seem to work:

1. Didn't change directory
2. Variables not visible

Why not?

	- variables are "local" to the shell script, aren't passed to shell that runs it
	- similarly with current directory, script's current directory is independent of shell's current directory

How can we make them work?

	- source with . ./start_lab04.sh (period before the script name)
	- this runs the contents of the script within the same shell, instead of a separate shell

What about start_lab04.sh running another script?

	- current directory passed by default (but independent as before)
	- variables not passed unless you do `export ex1=jpg2png` or use `. ./start_lab04_print.sh`
