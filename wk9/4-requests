how to install package?

  on CSE: if we want you to use it, it will be installed
  outside of CSE: refer to lectures (keywords: pip, venv/virtualenv)

how to get help online/offline?

  offline: import requests; help(requests)
  online: linked from pypi.org, or just google/etc

    !! online help not available in exam environments !!

import requests -- for fetching webpages directly instead of subprocess + curl
