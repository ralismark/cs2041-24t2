Extract
-------

Given one or more archive files as command line arguments, use the correct program to extract the files.

e.g. ./extract.sh a.tar.gz b.zip

(using case & functions)

---

Notes about functions:
- Variables set in a function are visible outside the function
- Can import functions from other files via sourcing -- . ./functions.sh
- Declaring a function with the same name as an existing one overwrites the old one
